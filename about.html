         <h2 class="aboutH2">So glad you stopped by my blog! I live in nothern Norway with the mountains right in my back yard,
            from here my family hunts alot and love to make food from scratch. On this blog i will share my favorite recipies from all seasons year round.</h2>
         <p class="aboutP">Growing up, I was surrounded by food. My mom was a great cook and she made sure that we had the best of everything. I also developed a passion for hunting and dancing at an early age. Both of these activities kept me busy and gave me a sense of purpose. But it was my mom's cooking that truly shaped my life. She taught me how to appreciate food, how to make it, and how to share it with others. My story is all about the joys of food, family, hunting, and dancing.

            Now, I'm on a new journey - one that I'm excited to share with all of you! Follow me as I explore different cultures through their food and discover what it means to be home wherever you are.
